## Create a Story

This project goal's was to create the game Story Cubes. 
With 9 random pictures you have to create a story. 
This is a good game to use in a Conversation Class.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Anchor to the same page (HTML);
- Radio input (HTML);
- Responsive design (CSS);
- Hover effects(CSS);
- Splice method (JavaScript);
- Refresh the page (JavaScript);
- Arrays (JavaScript);
- If/else (JavaScript);
- Forking (GitHub);
- Requesting code review (GitHub).
